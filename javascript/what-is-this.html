  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>
    'this' can change depending on the context!
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>For functions (not methods), 'this' refers to the window object.</li>
    <li>For methods, 'this' refers to the object through which you call the method.</li>
    <li>For event handlers, 'this' refers to the object that triggered the event.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The new 'class syntax' in JavaScript clears up a lot of this confusion and acts more like 'this' in Java</p>
