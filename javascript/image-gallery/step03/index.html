  <div id="image-gallery-container"></div>

  <h3>Pre-reqs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Understanding of <b>variable scope</b> in JavaScript (review what we learned in Web Programming).
      <b>Global variables</b> are visible by any JS code, including any code in other .js files that are used by the page.
    </li>
    <li>Understanding of objects (properties and methods), and nested objects</li>
    <li>We may want to review js-and-functions.html (maybe after would be better).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Don't Pollute the Global Namespace!</h3>
  <p>
    One of the golden rules of JavaScript is <b>don't pollute the global namespace!</b>
    Nowadays it's common for a single web page to include many, many modules.
    What happens if two modules include the exact same function name?
    We could experiment with this in class, but what it boils down to is that our web page becomes unstable/unpredictable
    (if there are two ImageGallery() functions, how do we know which one will be invoked when we call it?).
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution to this problem is to avoid using global variables in JavaScript.
    But how do we do this?
    We can nest our code inside of an object.
    We could potentially put all of our code, for all of our modules inside a single object.
    It might look something like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
var someObj = {

  ImageGallery: function(container, images){
    // code for our image gallery module goes here
  }

};
  </pre>
  <p>
    Now, in order to invoke the ImageGallery function, we'd have to do it through the object, like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
someObj.ImageGallery();  // Note that I have omitted the arguments/params.
  </pre>
  <p>
    We could then add all of our modules to this object, for example like this (you could call this a 'library' of modules):
  </p>
  <pre>
var someObj = {

  ImageGallery: function(container, images){
    // code for our image gallery module goes here
  }

  SomeOtherModule: function(){
    // code for some other module goes here
  }

};    
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that 'someObj' is not a very good name for the container of all of our modules, 
    becuase it's entirely possible that that variable name could be used by a novice programmer who might happen to include our library in his/her web page.
    So you want to choose a name that's likely to be unique (many developers use their domain name).
  </p>  
  <p>
    We call these container objects <b>namespaces</b> because they provide a named object which can contian our library.
    You could even organize your modules into categories by further nesting objects.
  </p>
  <pre>
var someObj = {

    galleries: {
      ImageGallery: function(){ /*code goes here*/ }
    },

    utils: {
      DateUtils: function(){ /*code goes here*/ },
      BusinessUtils: function(){ /*code goes here*/ }
    }

}
  </pre>
  <p>
    Unlike the above example, it's a good idea to keep each individual module in it's own .js file.
    But this can cause another problem, which we'll fix in a moment.
    Consider these two .js files:
  </p>
  <pre>
// image-gallery.js
var someObj = {
    
    ImageGallery: function(){
      // code goes here
    }

}


// some-other-module.js
var someObj = {
  
    SomeOtherModule: function(){
      // code goes here
    }

}
  </pre>
  <p>
    If we were to include both of these .js files in our web page, then one version of someObj would conflict with another.
    So how do we get around this problem?
    We'll here's a tricky bit of code to do just that:
  </p>
  <pre>
// image-gallery.js
var someObj = someObj || {};

someObj.ImageGallery = function(){
  // code for ImageGallery goes here
};


// some-other-module.js
var someObj = someObj || {};

someObj.SomeOtherModule = function(){
  // code goes here
};

  </pre>
  <p>
    Do you see what's happening here? Lets just focus on this line of code (which appears in both .js files):
  </p>
  <pre>
var someObj = someObj || {};
  </pre>
  <p>
    There is actually a boolean expression being evaluated to the right of the equal sign.
    It's saying 'if someObj exists, then assign that to the left side of the equal sign'.
    Remember our discusion about truthy/falsey values? 
    So if someObj evaluates to true, then that will be the result of the boolean expression.
    But if it evaluates to false, then an empty object <b>{}</b> will be the result of the boolean expression. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll see code like this in many JavaScript libraries.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Coding Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    Refactor your image gallery module so that it is safely nested inside of a 'namespace' object.
    The variable name for your object should be something that is very likely to be unique (if you care about branding your namespace, you'll use a catchy name as well).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that after you put the ImageGallery function into an object, you'll also have to make a change to the way you are referring to ImageGallery() on this page.
    To invoke the ImageGallery() function on this page, you'll have to first refer to the namespace object and then use the dot operator before the call to ImageGallery().
