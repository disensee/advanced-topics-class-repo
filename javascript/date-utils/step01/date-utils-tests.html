	<input type="button" id="btnToday" value="Today's Date" />
	<h3>Part 1 - Code Review</h3>
	<p>
		Inspect the JavaScript code in this file and in the <b>date-utils.js</b> file.
		Make sure you understand it, maybe even inspect it in the debugger. 
		<br>
		The code uses the built-in Date object, here is an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp" target="_blank">API reference</a> that will help you answer the following questions.
		<br>
		Here's another resource for the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-date-in-javascript/" target="_">Date object</a>.

	<h3>Part 2 - Coding Exercises</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				If you look inside the date-utils.js file, you'll see that there is a function called <b>isOldEnoughToVote()</b>.
				Right now it's just a <b>stub</b>, meaning that it's an empty function. 
				Your job is to <b>implement</b> the code for this function.
				The comments above the function stub should give you enough information to write the implementation code.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you are working on the function, use the script tag at the bottom of this page to test your code.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Decompose the format() method according to the single responsibility rule (in order to do this, you'll have to add a few methods to the dateUtils object).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

<script>
	// test the isOldEnoughToVote() function here....
