	<h3>Part 1 - Code Review</h3>
	<p>
		Inspect the JavaScript code in this file and in the <b>date-utils.js</b> file.
		Make sure you understand it, maybe even inspect it in the debugger. 
		<br>
		The code uses the built-in Date object, here is an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp" target="_blank">API reference</a> that will help you answer the following questions.
		<br>
		Here's another resource for the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-date-in-javascript/" target="_">Date object</a>.

	<h3>Questions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Explain the return value of the getMonth() method of the Date API in JavaScript. 
			Be sure to mention the data type that the method returns.
			<pre>
getMonth() returns an integer (0-11) that represents the month of a specified date object. January is 0 and December is 11. 
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain the return value of the getDay() method of the Date API in JavaScript?
			<pre>
getDay() returns an integer (0-6) that represents the day of the week for a specified date object. Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6.  
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain how the monthName variable is initialized.
			<pre>
The monthName variable is initialized by creating an array of strings (named monthNames) that represents the names of the months. The array works in place of an object because months 
are zero indexed. From here, monthName is declared and initialized to the month name in the monthNames array by using getMonth() to get the month's index in the array. 
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the purpose of the dayNames array?
			<pre>
The dayNames array serves the same purpose as the monthNames array. It allows us to use getDay() to retreive an index and use that index to get the name of the day.  
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			What are at least two changes you could make to the code for the format() function to make it more flexible?
			<pre>
Parameters could be passed in so that any date object could be formatted. Decomposing the method also makes it more flexible because you can return various formats
instead of being stuck with the one return format. 
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			What is <b>decomposition</b> in programming?
			<pre>
Decomposition in programming is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it down into parts that are easier to undersatnd, program, and maintain. 
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the <b>single responsibility rule (SRR)</b>?
			<pre>
The single responsibility rule states that every class or module in a program should be responsible for a single part of the program's functionality. 
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			As a programmer, do you need to understand all the code in the .js file in order to us it to display formatted dates in a web page (such as this one)?
			<pre>
No
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain the <b>abstraction principle</b>.
			<pre>
The abtraction principle's main goal is to hide complexity by hiding unncessary details from a user. This enables a user to implement more complex logic on top of 
the provided abstraction without having to understand or think about the hidden complexity. 
			</pre>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Part 2 - Coding Exercises</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				If you look inside the date-utils.js file, you'll see that there is a function called <b>isOldEnoughToVote()</b>.
				Right now it's just a <b>stub</b>, meaning that it's an empty function. 
				Your job is to <b>implement</b> the code for this function.
				The comments above the function stub should give you enough information to write the implementation code.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you are working on the function, use the script tag at the bottom of this page to test your code.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Decompose the format() method according to the single responsibility rule (in order to do this, you'll have to add a few methods to the dateUtils object).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

<script>
	window.addEventListener('load', function(){
		var birthday = new Date(2002, 0, 28);
		alert(dateUtils.isOldEnoughToVote(birthday));
	});
