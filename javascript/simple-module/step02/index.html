	</ul>

	<h3>Encapsulating Code in JavaScript Modules</h3>
	<p>
	There are lots of different design patterns for creating modules in JavaScript.
	The latest version of JavaScript (ES6) allows you to create classes, which is a great way to organize your code into modules.
	In this lesson we'll look a how we used to simulate classes in our JavaScript code.</p>

	<p>
	Spend a few minutes looking at the code in the .js file for this step, and notice that a new object has been returned by our SimpleModule function.
	This object will contain the public API for our module, which allows client code to interact with the objects (and libraries) that we create.
	</p>

	<p>
	Just above the return statement, notice that a <b>setter</b> method has been created.
	</p>
	<pre>
function setFirstName(newFirstName){
	firstName = newFirstName;
}
	</pre>
	<p>
		Also note that the setFirstName function is included in the object that the SimpleModule function returns:
	</p>
	<pre>
return {
  update:update,
  setFirstName:<b>setFirstName</b>
};
	</pre>

<p>
Now our <b>client code</b> has a way to interact with the module.
The object that get's returned is the <b>public API</b> for our module.
It looks a little strange, but we are basically building an object that has properties
that reference each method that we want to make available to the client code.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned earlier, there are lots of approaches to creating modules in JavaScript.
The approach that we've used here is called the <b>revealing module pattern</b>.
The idea is to reveal the public API of your module in an object that gets returned.
For more information, check out <a href="http://jargon.js.org/_glossary/REVEALING_MODULE_PATTERN.md" target="_blank">this</a> link.
</p>

<p>
Now look at the JavaScript code that is at the top of this .html page (this is the 'client code' because it is using the module - the module is providing a service to the client!).
Note that we are storing the returned object in a variable called <b>simpleMod</b>
This object has two methods that we can call on it (setFirstName and update)
</p>

<p>
Just below that line of code, we set up and event handler function that invokes the two methods.
</p>

<p>
Now that you have studied the code, go ahead and press the buttons at the top of this page to test out the SimpleModule!
</p>
</p>

<h3>Assignment - Part 1</h3>
<p>
	Use the SimpleModule function to create another instance of the module.
	When you invoke the function, pass in an object that has a 'container' property and a 'firstName' property.
	The value for the 'container' property should be a reference to the div element on this page that has it's id attribute set to 'sample-container'.
	The value for the 'firstName' propert should be set to the string 'Buster'.
</p>
<p>
	Make sure you are passing in the proper arguments, and that they are the the proper data type. 
	To help you with this, look at the doc comments in the .js file.
</p>
<h3>Assignment - Part 2</h3>
<p>
	Convert the code in simple-module.js into a class using the (relatively) new class syntax in JavaScript.
	In the js folder you'll find a file called SimpleModule.js.
	Your job is to implement the code in the class so that it works just like the code in simple-module.js.
	If you look in the script element at the top of this page you'll see that the client code is already in place.
	An instance of the SimpleModule class is 
	created and an 'options' argument is passed into the constructor.
	In order to implement the code in the class, you'll probably have to do some research on 'class syntax in ES6'.
</p>

<h3>Assignment - Part 3</h3>
