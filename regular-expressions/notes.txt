This is a great quote:
    
    Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 
    "I know, I'll use regular expressions." 
    Now they have two problems.

	The quote is from Jamie Zawinski


We'll use regular expressions when we build restful-web-services.

Main points:
1. Regular expressions are used to find patterns in strings
2. You define a pattern to search for, and then you apply that pattern to a string to see if there is a 'match'
3. There are special characters (known as META CHARACTERS) that are used that have special meaining when creating patterns
   for example: ^cat The carrot means that the pattern will only match if 'cat' occurs at the beginning of a new line in a string  
   for another example cat$ The dollar sign means that cat must appear at the end of a line in a string
4. If you want to use a meta character in your pattern (ex: you want to search for '^cat') you must escape it with a \, like this \^cat
5. There are a couple of different standards for regular expressions (posix, pcre), which makes it very confusing! 


When running regular expressions, you can 'capture' data from strings that match the pattern.

$string = "products/7";               // The string to test
$pattern = '/^products\/([0-9]*)$/';  // The pattern - the () encloses the part of the match that we want to capture
$matches = null;                      // Used to capture data from the matching string

preg_match($pattern, $string, $matches);

// $mathes will be an array of all capture groups in the string



Activity/Assignment
Choose your language and create code samples that demonstrate the use of regular expressions
1. Demonstrate how to validate a phone number
2. An email address
3. A date
4. A password that has at least one number and one capital letter
