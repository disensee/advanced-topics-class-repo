	HOW SHOULD YOU TEST THE MODULE?
	Make sure the request method is getting set properly
	Make sure the URL is getting set properly
	Make sure the callback function is getting invoked when a request completes successfully
	Make sure the proper param is being passed into the callback when it is invoked
	Make sure that when the 'headers' option is passed in, the proper request headers are getting set
	Make sure that when the 'requestBody' option is passed in, it is getting sent in the body of the request
	Make sure that when the 'errorCallback' option is passed in, it is getting invoked with the proper params when the request fails.
		To return an error from the server you do it like this in your PHP code:
		header($_SERVER["SERVER_PROTOCOL"] . ' 500 Internal Server Error', true, 500);
